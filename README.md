## Welcome to cross score tracker ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‰ [Try the Web App!](https://cross-score-tracker.mariussuflea.com/)

this is my very first React Native Expo app, It marks my first milestone in the world of cross-platform mobile development and my migration away from low-level native development.

### What is this?

This is a very simple web and mobile app that allows you to track your scores in the very popular (in Romania) card game "Cruce" (translated as "Cross" in English). 

### Main features

- Keeps score (obviously)
- 2-4 players (as you cannot play alone, silly!)
- Idiotproof (no need to explain how to use it)

### UI Preview

### Why does it exist?

Many times I found myself playing Cruce with my friends and nowadays we do not carry pen and paper with us, so we needed a way to keep track of our scores to eliminate cheating and disputes that might arise from "just remembering" it.
